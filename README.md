# Advent of Code 2025

Solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

This project was created to enjoy solving the problems in the '25 advent, but also used as an excuse to learn Rust. I'm a bit of a Polyglot, but mostly coming from the JavaScript (TypeScript) world. Code here reflects my thinking to solve complex problems, but also my learning journey to become more Rustacean.

## Building

Build the project using Cargo:

```bash
cargo build
```

## Running

Run a specific day's solution:

```bash
cargo run -- <day>
```

Where `<day>` is a number between 1 and 12.

Example:

```bash
cargo run -- 1
```
